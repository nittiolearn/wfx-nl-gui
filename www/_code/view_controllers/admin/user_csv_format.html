    <h3>Syntax of CSV file fields</h3>
    <p>
        The input file for import is in the same CSV format as the one exported. The best way to understand the CSV format is to create few users and export the data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Operation: </b> Mandatory - 'c' (create), 'C' (create with default password), 'u' (update), 'U' (update with default password), 'e' (send password email only), 'E' (configure random password without sending mail), or 'i' (ignore).
            Each row when importing could be an instruction to create, update (including deactivate), or notify a user.
            'C'/'U' option creates/updates a user with default password = login user name. This does not generate registration mail.
            The user can login with username='user_id.groupid' and password='user_id.groupid')
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Key: </b> Mandatory - is of format "user id.group id". Only in the case the user is modified and the user id is to be changed, key is useful. In such a case, key is the old "user id.group id" and user id is the new one. Nittio Admin has possibility to move a user from one group to another. In such a case, the import has to be done from the target group and the key should be of form "userid.sourcegroupid".
